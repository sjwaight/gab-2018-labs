# Labs for Global Azure Bootcamp 2018

Welcome to the Sydney labs listing for this year. Feel free to use as you see fit.

## Official Labs

These labs require you to use the full Visual Studio client - you can download the Community edition for free (for non-commercial use) [online](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). We recommend doing this before you come on the day because it can take some time to install.

These labs are pretty heavy duty and cover the entire DevOps spectrum - expect them to exceed the time allocation on the day!

## Unofficial Labs

These are a range of existing labs you can tackle on the day - we have tried to make them easily accessible by choosing ones that do not require you to have Visual Studio installed. They cover a range of programming languages and hosting concepts.
